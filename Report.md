## 1.Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:
* EIN and NAME—Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
* USE_CASE—Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION—Organization type
* STATUS—Active status
* INCOME_AMT—Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
* ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively



## 2.Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:
### Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The variable target is the column IS_SUCCESSFUL because since it could indicate whether the money was used effectively in an application request or not.

* What variable(s) are the features for your model?

    * APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
    * AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
    * CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
    * USE_CASE—Use case for funding
    * ORGANIZATION—Organization type
    * STATUS—Active status
    * INCOME_AMT—Income classification
    * SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
    * ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested


* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

EIN and NAME—Identification columns

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?


* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
